## Overview

This project focuses on exploring and comparing different architectures and algorithms in deep learning, specifically for computer vision and natural language processing (NLP). The final project is divided into three primary modules:

1. **Comparison of CNN Architectures**
2. **Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) Algorithms with and without Attention Mechanism**
3. **Development of a Miniature ChatGPT Model**

## Project Modules

### 1. CNN Architecture Comparison

#### What is CNN?
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network designed for analyzing grid-like data such as images. CNNs are fundamental in state-of-the-art computer vision systems.

#### Key Components of CNNs:
- **Convolutional Layers:** Use filters to detect patterns such as edges and textures.
- **Pooling Layers:** Reduce spatial dimensions while retaining important information.
- **Activation Functions:** Introduce non-linearity, allowing the network to learn complex patterns.
- **Fully Connected Layers:** Perform final classification or regression based on extracted features.

#### Models Compared:
- **LeNet-5:** Early CNN model designed for digit recognition.
- **AlexNet:** Introduced in 2012; revolutionized deep learning with GPU training, ReLU activation, and dropout.
- **VGG-16:** Demonstrated effectiveness using very deep networks with small convolutional filters.
- **GoogLeNet (Inception V1):** Introduced Inception modules for multi-scale feature capture.
- **ResNet-18:** Addressed the vanishing gradient problem with residual connections.
- **SENet (Squeeze and Excitation Network):** Enhanced representational power with channel recalibration.

#### Performance Metrics:
- Evaluated on datasets like CIFAR-10, MNIST, and Fashion-MNIST.

### 2. Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) Algorithms

#### What is Seq2Seq?
A Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) algorithm transforms one sequence into another, useful for tasks like:
- Machine Translation
- Text Summarization
- Chatbot Responses
- Speech Recognition
- Image Captioning

#### Key Components:
- **Encoder:** Processes input sequences into a context vector.
- **Decoder:** Generates output sequences from the context vector.

#### Attention Mechanism:
- **Dynamic Contextual Focus:** Improves the model’s ability to capture relevant information.
- **Improved Handling of Long Sequences:** Allows access to all encoder states, mitigating information bottleneck.
- **Enhanced Performance:** Leverages attention weights to generate more accurate and contextually relevant outputs.

### 3. Generative Pretrained Transformer (Miniature ChatGPT)

#### What is a Transformer?
The Transformer architecture handles sequential data efficiently, particularly suited for NLP tasks such as translation, text generation, and summarization.

#### Key Components:
- **Self-Attention Mechanism:** Computes attention scores for each word relative to all other words.
- **Multi-Head Attention:** Allows the model to focus on different parts of the input.
- **Positional Encoding:** Provides context about the position of each word in the sequence.
- **Feed-Forward Neural Network:** Processes outputs of the attention mechanism.
- **Encoder-Decoder Architecture:** Processes input sequences and generates outputs.

## Project Outputs

- **Module 1:** Detailed comparison of CNN architectures with performance analysis on various datasets.
- **Module 2:** Implementation of Seq2Seq models with and without attention, demonstrating performance improvements.
- **Module 3:** Development of a miniature ChatGPT using Transformer architecture.
